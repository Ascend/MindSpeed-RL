    # In verl, the driver process aggregates the computation results of workers via Ray. 
    # Therefore, after a worker completes its computation job, it will package the output 
    # using tensordict and transfer it to the CPU. Since the `to` operation of tensordict 
    # is non-blocking, when transferring data from a device to the CPU, it is necessary to 
    # ensure that a batch of data has been completely transferred before being used on the 
    # host; otherwise, unexpected precision issues may arise. Tensordict has already noticed 
    # this problem and fixed it.
    # However, the relevant modifications only cover CUDA and MPS devices and do not take effect 
    # for third-party devices such as NPUs. This patch fixes this issue, and the relevant 
    # modifications can be removed once the fix is merged into tensordict.
